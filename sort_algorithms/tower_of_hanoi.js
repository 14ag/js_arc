/**
 * In this challenge, you will solve the towers of Hanoi problem for five disks,
 *  by writing a recursive function solveHanoi that will solve Hanoi for any positive number of disks.
 *  A call to solveHanoi(numDisks,fromPeg,toPeg) should move numDisks disks from
 *  the peg fromPeg to the peg toPeg.
 *  Start by implementing the base case of zero disks.
